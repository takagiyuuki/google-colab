Repository for studying Machine Learning (including Hugging Face and TensorFlow) and Python on Google Colab.


# Why
I am learning Google Colab for its collaborative and cloud-based nature, providing easy access to powerful computing resources. It facilitates seamless collaboration on projects, enhances my ability to work on resource-intensive tasks, and allows me to share and showcase code and data analyses efficiently. Additionally, the integration with popular machine learning frameworks makes it a valuable tool for developing and experimenting with machine learning models.
